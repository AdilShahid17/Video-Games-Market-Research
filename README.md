# Market Research for a New Video Game Company

## Introduction and Motivation

Market research is critical for any new market entrant, whether a startup or an established company venturing into a new product or market. Releasing a new product is risky, as data shows that approximately 95% of new products fail. Therefore, understanding the market is essential. Market research encompasses everything from market sizing and competitor analysis to yearly trends.

In this project, we conducted preliminary market research for a startup aiming to enter the video game industry. Our goal was to identify the platform, genre, and region that would maximize revenue. We used a publicly available dataset that includes video games released between 1977 and 2016, each of which sold more than 100,000 copies.

Our objective is to analyze video game sales to identify trends related to genre, publisher, platform, and release year across different regions (North America, Japan, and the rest of the world). This will help our client forecast the future video game market for 2017 and make informed decisions about entering the market.

## Summary Report

- **Genre Analysis**: Action games have consistently been the most popular genre globally. However, since 2010, shooter games have had the highest average sales per title.
- **Regional Analysis**:

- For the Japanese market, target the role-playing genre on the Nintendo DS platform.
